We had a one hour zoom meeting today at 15:00. 
We discussed the specific division of labor and rejected the previous discussion of using an MVP for the Project. 
Barry has most of the stuff done for the Fire database. 
The four remaining people decided to start by assigning 4 different pages. 
Chengye chose to do the 4th user stories, 
Jumana chose to do the 3rd user stories, 
Yu chose to do the 7th user stories, 
and Perry decided to do an additional feature that would allow the admins to decide to delete and change appointments.

Before coding, we can unify the JDM environment and the emulator version.
Android API 33  &&  Pixel 2 API 30



//Person 1

Name: Chengye Wu

What have you done since yesterday?
	- I managed to understand the process of Android development. some people on Youtube answered my questions very well. I can now independently develop a very simple Android application through Android Studio.

What are you planning on doing today?
	- We will be assigning tasks today. I'm looking forward to this happening. Ever since the first class on svn, I've been looking forward to simulating a real workplace as a team developing software.

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- I was worried that if we didn't use MVP, it would make our code look cumbersome. Because every page needs to be reconnected with firebase. But everyone has decided not to use MVP, and I think we should do it.
