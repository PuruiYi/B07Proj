We had a one hour zoom meeting today at 15:00. 
We discussed the specific division of labor and rejected the previous discussion of using an MVP for the Project. 
Barry has most of the stuff done for the Fire database. 
The four remaining people decided to start by assigning 4 different pages. 
Chengye chose to do the 4th user stories, 
Jumana chose to do the 3rd user stories, 
Yu chose to do the 7th user stories, 
and Perry decided to do an additional feature that would allow the admins to decide to delete and change appointments.
