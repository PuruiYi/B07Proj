//Person 1

Name: Chengye Wu

What have you done since yesterday?
	- Barry created three buttons on the activity page, but only one was displayed. When I tried to add another button, 
	only one button was displayed as well. I googled it and knew it was overlapping, but didn't know how to change it, 
	and then understood it after browsing to the LinearLayout layout.

What are you planning on doing today?
	- I am going to merge my code with the master trunk. After the successful integration, 
	I would like to improve some things. For example, UI design.

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- I have tried many methods. But they all change the original pattern. 
	So I can only add a button under each item, and through this button I can go to the user story 4 page.
