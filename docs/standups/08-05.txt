What have you done since yesterday?
	- Barry created three buttons on the activity page, but only one was displayed. When I tried to add another button, only one button was displayed as well. I googled it and knew it was overlapping, but didn't know how to change it, and then understood it after browsing to the LinearLayout layout.

What are you planning on doing today?
	- I am going to merge my code with the master trunk. After the successful integration, I would like to improve some things. For example, UI design.

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	- In LinearLayout is horizontal by default (you can think of it as dividing an interface vertically into N areas, with buttons arranged from left to right). So when my two buttons are set to width match_parent (horizontal spread out a line), height wrap_content (according to the size of the button content set height) originally a line can accommodate N buttons, the results set match_parent, directly break this split area, the first button directly accounted for a line. So it overlaps.
