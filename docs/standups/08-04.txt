We have an online meeting today with Aryan at 17:10. After this meeting, 
we will have a small meeting of five people. 
We will discuss the parts that each of us has completed so far and then discuss what needs to be completed next.

//Person 1

Name: Chengye Wu

What have you done since yesterday?
	I'm basically done with my part.

What are you planning on doing today?
	I will try to blend my part with the main code. And need to attend a meeting today.

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
	It's mainly some database issues. I need some other people's content to be completed first before I can call some data. Maybe I can try to add some examples to the database and then come to use them.
