Today we focused on task assignment. 
We decided to complete our Project with MVP (Model View Presenter), 
which separates data processing, data display and logic control of the application, 
and organizes the code in a way that separates business logic, data display and interface, 
which allows us to do the front-end and back-end separately. 

Because we agreed that each person doing a page would make our division of labor very unclear. 
In particular, if one person didn't finish his section for a long time, 
then the other person would have to wait for a long time. So after today's discussion, 
we decided that the three people who are not familiar with MVP need to go to youtube to learn from videos. 
Then we will officially assign the tasks the next day.
